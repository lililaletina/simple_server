Node.js should be installed in your laptop

1) create package.json (npm init);
2) add .gitignore file and include /node_modules inside (understand why we need it in git)
3) add file users.json and create several users inside (as an object where keys are ids and values are user info (name, email, etc))
4) install express.js (https://expressjs.com/)
5) create a simple server with express which contains one route (GET /users)
6) inside that route you should open file users.json (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback) and return back file's content
